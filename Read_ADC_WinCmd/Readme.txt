Read_ADC_WinCmd is a example of read all channels once in Microsoft Windows Command Prompt window.
1. It was compiled by Visual Studio 2005 which I have a license. Free Visual Studio Community version should be okay but I'm not tested. 
2. How to use?
  a. Ensure Read_ADC.exe and SLABHIDDevice.dll are in the same directory.
  b. Connect the hardware to PC. (This is no need to install any driver.) (Hardware can be ordered from www.taobao.com)
  c. Windows->search->"command prompt"
  d. In the popup window, run Read_ADC.exe, will show like this.
     ...>Read_ADC.exe
      0=0.28V;  1=0.28V;  2=0.28V;  3=0.28V;  4=0.28V;  5=0.28V;  6=0.28V;  7=0.28V;  8=0.28V;  9=0.00V;
      10=0.00V; 11=0.00V; 12=0.00V; 13=0.00V; 14=0.00V; 15=0.00V; 16=0.00V; 17=0.00V; 18=0.00V; 19=0.00V;
3. Anything need help, you can mail to gr_li@163.com, or guanrong.li@silabs.com if it reachable which means I'm still working in Silicon Labs. (^_^)
