USB HID bootloader of EFM8UB10
1. This .sls file can be imported to Simplicity Studio to compile or debug. A free Keil C51 license can be ordered from Simplicity Studio. Simplicity Studio can be downloaded from www.silabs.com
2. It's the original source code from Silicon Labs. It was programmed when chip ship out from Silicon Labs.
3. It can be changed freely if want.
4. If bootloader was damaged, need use C2 interface re-program. A hardware debugger will be used, like Silicon Labs Toolstick, UDA-8(UDA-32) or J-Link from www.segger.com. Those debugger can be used to debug EFM8UB10 software too.
5. Anything need help, you can mail to gr_li@163.com, or guanrong.li@silabs.com if it reachable which means I'm still working in Silicon Labs. (^_^)
