1. 10nF ADC input capacitor was replaced to 68pF or 100uF or others. The use of this capacitor was described bellow.

2. EEPROM was not mounted. It was used in another project - Multiple I2C(10-Channels).
3. SPI Nor flash was not mounted. It was used in another project - Multiple SPI(5-Channels).
4. Anything need help, you can mail to gr_li@163.com, or guanrong.li@silabs.com if it's reachable which means I'm still working in Silicon Labs. (^_^)
